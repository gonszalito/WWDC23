#  WWDC23 Winner Project - Counting Stars

This was my project that made me a **WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge** Scholar! In this project I wanted to utilize Apple's Vision Framework to detect hand poses or more specifically the number of fingers a person is holding up, and I turn that idea into sort of a game to count how many stars are currently shown on the screen and the player has to show the same number of fingers to the camera.

**Short Demo**

Though there are definitely lots of errors to be found throughout the source code itself and that the hand detection itself is not entirely perfect I am proud and grateful to be chosen as a WWDC awardee and also here are some of amazing guides that helped me finalize the project
