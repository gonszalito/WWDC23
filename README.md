#  WWDC23 Winner Project - Counting Stars

This was my project that made me a **WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge** Scholar! In this project I wanted to utilize Apple's Vision Framework to detect hand poses or more specifically the number of fingers a person is holding up, and I turn that idea into sort of a game to count how many stars are currently shown on the screen and the player has to show the same number of fingers to the camera.

Though there are definitely lots of errors to be found throughout the source code itself and that the hand detection itself is not entirely perfect I am proud and grateful to be chosen as a WWDC awardee and also here are some of amazing guides that helped me finalize the project
